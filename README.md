BIMJSON is a format for transferring information to another party without the need for external guarantors or trusted ‘third parties’, enabling data to be exchanged within 3D-7D systems and between construction parties directly, bypassing any third-party companies controlling data storage and transfer. BIMJSON data – allows you to automate work with project data. In order to get automatic data from thousands of projects automatically, you need to build the pipeline once on the open tools.
